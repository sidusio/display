# Display

A simple, client-side only webpage to display various content types based on URL parameters.

## Philosophy

The goal of "Display" is to be a lightweight, simple, and minimal-dependency tool. It's designed to be used in situations where you just need to quickly show some information (like on a kiosk screen, a dashboard, or during a presentation) without any complex setup, server, or build process.

Just open index.html with the correct parameters, and it works.

## Features

- Text: Display a large block of text.
- QR Code: Generate and display a QR code from a string (like a URL or text).
- Countdown: Show a live countdown timer to a specific date and time.
- Extensible: Easily add new display "types" by editing the client-side JavaScript.

## Contributing

This project is meant to be simple. If you have an idea for a new display type (e.g., a simple clock, an image viewer) that fits the "minimal dependency" philosophy, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
